## Description

 building a multi-section landing page. Oftentimes, we don't know how much content will be added to a  page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, I did dynamically add the content to the  page. I demonstrated this with the navigation menu. Additionally, I have done dynamically building  the navigation great precursor by the virtual DOM.

 To improve the user experience, the section is actively being viewed to be differentiated.  Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls you to the appropriate  section smoothly rather than giving you the default jump.

## How To Use

1. by clicking on any section name in the navigation bar navigation bar.
2. by scrolling the web page.
3. add a new section to the page in index.html.
